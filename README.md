## **📖 About the Project**

Explain the purpose of the project in 2–4 sentences.

Example:
This project compares Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LightGBM models using the Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction dataset. The goal is to evaluate model performance in terms of accuracy, AUC, and training time to determine the most efficient and reliable method for binary classification.

## **✨ Features**

* Clean and modular codebase
* Multiple machine learning models
* Visualizations for ROC curves and performance comparison
* Easy-to-run scripts
* Jupyter notebook included

---

## **🧰 Tech Stack**

* Python 3.x
* NumPy, Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* LightGBM
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## **📊 Dataset**

Describe where the dataset comes from.

Example:
This project uses the **Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction Dataset** from Kaggle:

## **📈 Results**

Summarise your findings.

Example:

* LightGBM achieved the highest AUC (0.78)
* Random Forest performed well but took longer to train
* Decision Tree had the fastest training time but lowest accuracy

Include sample visuals:

```
ROC Curve Comparison:
- LightGBM (AUC = 0.78)
- Random Forest (AUC = 0.75)
- Decision Tree (AUC = 0.63)
```
